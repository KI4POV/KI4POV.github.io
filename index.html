<p>	Hi, I'm Will, KI4POV. I am an avid electronics and retrocomputing hobbyist. I have no formal training in either electronics or programming, so the projects you see documented here are amateur in every sense of the word. My goal is primarily to document my projects for my own sake, but I do hope that someone may be able to gain something from this, even if it's just seeing one more way NOT to do something.<br><br> 73,<br>Will-KI4POV </p>
